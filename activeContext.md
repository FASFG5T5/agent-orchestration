# Active Context

_Last updated: Renamed to Agent Orchestration_

## Current Focus

Agent Orchestration - MCP server for multi-agent coordination across IDEs and CLI tools.

## Active Agents

_No active agents. Start the MCP server and register agents to see them here._

## In Progress

_No tasks in progress._

## Pending Tasks

_No pending tasks. Create tasks using the `task_create` tool._

## Recent Decisions

- **name**: Renamed from mcp-orchestrator to agent-orchestration
- **compatibility**: Added AGENTS.md support for cross-IDE compatibility
- **runtime**: TypeScript/Node.js for easier installation
- **database**: better-sqlite3 for synchronous, high-performance SQLite

## Context Notes

- **turn_based_execution**: Agents check `is_my_turn` before starting work
- **sub_agent_workflow**: Sub-agents use `claim_todo` to register + claim in one call
- **shared_memory_namespaces**: context, decisions, findings, blockers
